# Carbon Dixocide Emissions - Data Visualization

With the use of D3.js, this [DEMO](https://determined-lichterman-22a68b.netlify.com/) visualizes how CO2 emissions by country has changed in 21 years and also shows the inequality in emissions across the world.

- The map chart visualizes CO2 emissions by country and by year. Users can adjust the year and adjust to represent emissions or emissions per capita.

- The pie chart visualizes the total emissions by continent and region. When users click on a country on the map chart, they can see a breakdown of its emissions by year on the bar chart.
